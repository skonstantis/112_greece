This is a React app showing all 112 alerts that were sent to Greece since the beginning of the service. 
The alerts are updated manually periodically, since there is no api provided by the government.
The project uses React, css, and typescript while it follows the MVC pattern.
Upon completion, the app will be displayed on a website.
